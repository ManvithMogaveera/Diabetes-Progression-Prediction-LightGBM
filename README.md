💉 Diabetes Prediction using LightGBM 🚀
📌 Overview

This project uses the Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) algorithm to predict the likelihood of diabetes based on medical and lifestyle data.
With 100,000+ records sourced from a publicly available Kaggle dataset, the model leverages gradient boosting for high accuracy and low computational cost.

The goal is to create a fast, scalable, and reliable prediction system that can assist healthcare professionals in early detection and preventive treatment planning.
